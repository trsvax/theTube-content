Supply chain attacks are the growth industry of software security. A malicious package lands in your dependency tree, gets installed, exfiltrates credentials or mines crypto. It happened to thousands of projects via `event-stream` in 2018. It keeps happening.

The enterprise answer is a dedicated security team, a software composition analysis tool, a vulnerability management platform, and a lot of meetings. The solo developer answer is a few configuration files and GitHub.

## Dependabot

Enable it in the repo settings. Dependabot scans your `package.json` and lock files against the GitHub Advisory Database. When a vulnerability is found, it opens a PR with the fixed version. You review, you merge.

```yaml
# .github/dependabot.yml
version: 2
updates:
  - package-ecosystem: npm
    directory: /
    schedule:
      interval: weekly
```

That's it. You don't have to think about it until a PR appears.

## Copilot Autofix

When Dependabot opens an alert, the Security tab shows a "Generate fix with Copilot" button. Copilot explains what the vulnerability is, what the fix does, and opens a PR. For straightforward version bumps it's automatic. For breaking changes it explains the tradeoff.

The combination of Dependabot (detection) and Copilot (explanation + fix) means most vulnerabilities are resolved without you having to read a CVE.

## Scheduled scans

Dependabot covers known vulnerabilities in your direct and transitive dependencies. A scheduled GitHub Action can cover everything else — license compliance, outdated packages, custom checks.

```yaml
on:
  schedule:
    - cron: "0 9 * * 1" # every Monday at 9am
```

Same pattern as any other workflow. Runs weekly, opens an issue or PR if something needs attention.

## Supply chain protection

The scariest attacks aren't in known vulnerabilities — they're in packages that haven't been flagged yet. Two tools help:

**`minimum-release-age`** (pnpm v10.16+): blocks installing packages published less than N minutes ago. A typosquatting attack or a compromised maintainer account publishes a malicious version — this setting means you won't install it until it's been in the registry long enough for the community to notice.

```
minimum-release-age=10080  # 7 days in minutes
```

**Socket.dev GitHub App**: scans every PR for suspicious package behavior — new install scripts, new network access, new filesystem access. Free for open source. Flags the package before it lands in your lock file.

## What this costs

Dependabot: free. Copilot Autofix: included with Copilot. Scheduled Actions: free tier covers it. Socket.dev: free for public repos. `minimum-release-age`: a line in `.npmrc`.

Zero ongoing manual work. No security team. No SCA subscription.

A solo developer can have enterprise-grade supply chain security with zero ongoing manual work. It's all GitHub and a few configuration files.
